# Fixed Google Cloud Deployment Issues

## Problem Resolution
Fixed the Gunicorn worker initialization error that was preventing proper application startup in Google Cloud Run.

## Changes Made
- Created dedicated WSGI entry point (`wsgi.py`) for clean Gunicorn initialization
- Enhanced main.py with better error handling and logging
- Updated Dockerfile to use the new WSGI configuration
- Optimized Cloud Build settings for your existing service name

## Deploy the Fixed Version

```bash
# Commit fixes
git add main.py wsgi.py Dockerfile cloudbuild.yaml DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md
git commit -m "fix: Resolve Gunicorn WSGI initialization errors"
git push origin main

# Deploy using Cloud Build
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml
```

## Critical Environment Variables Needed

Your service will fail without these environment variables. Set them in Google Cloud Console:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://talentiq-user:YOUR_PASSWORD@/talentiq?host=/cloudsql/PROJECT_ID:us-central1:talentiq-db
SESSION_SECRET=your-32-character-random-string
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
FLASK_ENV=production
```

## Verification Steps

After deployment:
1. Check service status in Cloud Run console
2. Test health endpoint: `https://your-service-url/health`
3. Monitor logs for any remaining errors
4. Test application functionality

The WSGI configuration now properly initializes the Flask application and should eliminate the worker process errors you were seeing.
